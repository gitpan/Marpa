Marpa

This is alpha software.  It is an experimental fork from Parse::Marpa.

Marpa generates parses from any BNF grammar.  That includes recursive
grammars, ambiguous grammars, infinitely ambiguous grammars and
grammars with useless or empty productions.  If you can write it in
BNF, Marpa parses it.
