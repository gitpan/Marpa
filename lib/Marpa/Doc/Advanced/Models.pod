Marpa::Advanced::Models - Other Input Models

=head1 ABOUT THIS DOCUMENT

The alternative input models desribed in this document are an
advanced technique.
This document may safely be ignored by ordinary Marpa users.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Token Streams

Marpa's default input model is the traditional one --
a token stream.
Token streams are very standard in parsing applications --
so much so
that most texts do not take the trouble
of defining the term.
A B<token stream> is input structured as
a sequence of tokens,
where each token occupies one location
and every location has a token.
In the token stream model, all tokens are
of the same length.

Conventionally, all tokens are of length 1,
and the token stream starts at location 0.
Following this convention,
the I<N>th token would start at
location I<N-1> and end
at location I<N>.
For example,
the first token would start at location 0 and end at location 1.
The second token would start at location 1 and end at location 2.

=head2 Earlemes

The basic idea of location in Marpa is the B<earleme>.
Earlemes are named after Jay Earley.
Internally,
each earleme corresponds exactly and directly to an Earley set.
Every token has a start earleme and an end earleme.

The token stream model may also be called the token-per-earleme
model.
In the token stream model,
token location and earleme location
directly correspond on an one-to-one basis.
It can be useful to have the structure of the input relate to
earleme location in other ways.
One such alternative, which is useful and been tested,
is the character-per-earleme model, L<discussed
below|/"THE CHARACTER-PER-EARLEME MODEL">.

=head1 INTERFACE

Alternative models are implemented
using the optional third
and fourth parameters of the token descriptors.
Token descriptors are used in the arguments to the
L<Marpa Recognizer's tokens
method|Marpa::Recognizer/"tokens">.

=head2 Token Length

Token length is the optional third element of the token descriptor.
By default, it is 1, which is the correct value for the token stream
model.
Its value can be any integer B<greater> than zero.
Marpa does not allow zero length tokens in any input model.

=head2 Token Offset

The token offset
is the fourth element of each token's descriptor.
This is the offset to be added to the B<current earleme location>.
The B<current earleme location> is the earleme which
will be the start earleme of the
next token to be added.
When parsing begins, the current earleme location is
earleme 0.

When token offset is left undefined,
it defaults to 1.
That means the next token will be added at the next
earleme location after the current one.
This is the correct value for the token
stream model.

Negative token offsets are not allowed.
Zero token offset are allowed,
and will cause 
multiple tokens to start at the same location.
This in turn will cause lexing to be ambiguous.
Marpa supports ambiguous lexing.

=head1 AMBIGUOUS LEXING

Ambiguous lexing occurs when several different sequences
of tokens are possible.
Potentially ambiguous lexing occurs in any parse where multiple
tokens start at a single earleme.
An B<actual ambiguity> only occurs if
more than one of the potential token choices is consistent with
the grammar and previous input.
If there is no actual ambiguity, Marpa
will use the only token choice which is
consistent with the grammar and previous inputs.

When lexing is B<actually ambiguous>, Marpa
will use all consistent alternatives.
When the lexing in a parse is actually ambiguous,
the parse will be ambiguous.
From the point of view of Marpa's semantics,
ambiguity caused by lexing is exactly the
same as ambiguity caused by an ambiguous grammar.

In the standard
terminology,
a grammar is ambiguous
if it can produce more than one parse result,
and vice versa.
In Marpa this is not strictly true.
In Marpa,
an unambiguous grammar will produce than one parse,
if the lexing is actually ambiguous.
