Marpa::API::Tracing - Tracing Your Grammar

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes techniques for tracing and
debugging Marpa parses and grammars.

=head2 Check the Parse Exhaustion Location

If parsing failed before or at the end of input,
first look at the location in the input where parsing was exhausted.
That, along with inspection of the input and the grammar,
can be enough to pinpoint the problem.

=head2 Turn on Warnings

The next step is to make sure that 
Marpa's C<warnings> named arguments
for both the grammar and the recognizer
are turned on.
The C<warnings> named arguments are
on by default.

=head2 Turn off Stripping

When Marpa "strips" its objects,
it removes data that is not
needed for subsequent processing.
This saves time and memory, but data that is not
needed for processing
can be extremely valuable for debugging.
When objects are stripped,
many of Marpa's tracing methods will return
partial information or no information at all.

You should turn off Marpa's C<strip> named argument to the grammar.
C<strip> is on by default.
If you are
using the
L<recognizer's C<strip> method|Marpa::API::Recognizer/"strip">)
to strip the recognizer
you should stop doing that,
perhaps by commenting it out.

=head2 Trace Terminals

The next thing to do is to turn on the C<trace_terminals> recognizer named argument.
This tells you which tokens the recognizer is looking for and which ones it thinks it found.
If the problem is in lexing, C<trace_terminals> tells you the whole story.

Even if the problem is not in the lexing,
tracing terminals can tell you a lot.
Since Marpa uses prediction-driven lexing,
at any given parse location,
Marpa is only looking
for those tokens that it thinks
could result in a successful parse.
That means that the list of
tokens that the recognizer is looking for
tells you where
the recognizer thinks it is.

=head2 Double Check Rules and Symbols

It sometimes helps to look carefully at the output of
C<show_rules> and C<show_symbols>.
Check if anything there is
clearly not right or not what you expected.

=head2 Other Traces

C<trace_actions> will show you how action names are resolved to semantic
Perl closures.
Setting the C<trace_values> evaluator named argument to a trace level of 1
traces the values of the nodes as they are pushed on, and 
popped off, the evaluation stack.

You can trace the earley sets as they are completed,
but it is usually best to wait until input to the recognizer
is finished.
At that point call
L<the C<Marpa::Recognizer::show_earley_sets>
method|Marpa::API::Recognizer/"show_earley_sets">.
Since the items in the earley sets use QDFA states,
you usually will want to call
L<C<Marpa::Grammar::show_QDFA>
method|Marpa::API::Grammar/"show_QDFA"> as well.
The L<implementation document|Marpa::API::Implementation>
has example outputs from
the
C<show_earley_sets> and
C<show_QDFA>
methods,
and explains how to read them.

=head1 CHECKLIST

A complete investigation of a parse
would include the following:

=over 4

=item * Make sure the C<warnings> option is turned on.  It is on by default.

=item * Turn off the C<strip> Marpa named argument.  By default, it is on.

=item * Make sure you're not stripping the recognizer.

=item * Turn on the C<trace_terminals> recognizer named argument.

=item * Run C<show_symbols> on the precomputed grammar.

=item * Run C<show_rules> on the precomputed grammar.

=item * Turn on the C<trace_actions> evaluator named argument.

=item * Set the C<trace_values> evaluator named argument to level 1.

=item * Run C<show_earley_sets> on the recognizer.

=item * Run C<show_QDFA> on the precomputed grammar.

=back

When considering how much tracing to turn on,
remember that if the input text to the grammar is large,
the outputs from C<show_earley_sets>,
C<trace_terminals>,
and C<trace_values>
can be very lengthy.
You want to work with short inputs if at all possible.
