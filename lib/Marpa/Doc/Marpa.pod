=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 This is ALPHA software

This is B<alpha> software.
There may be bugs. The interface may change.
Please be careful.
Do not rely
on it for anything mission-critical.

=head2 Overview

L<Marpa> parses any language whose
grammar can be written in BNF.
That includes recursive grammars,
ambiguous grammars, infinitely ambiguous grammars and
grammars with useless or empty productions.

This document contains a top-level overview
of the API for the Marpa parse engine.
The two examples in this document
show the typical flows of Marpa method calls.
This document will use these examples
to describe the basic features of Marpa
in semi-tutorial fashion.
Marpa's advanced features, and full reference details of all features,
can be found in L<the other Marpa API documents|/"OTHER DOCUMENTS">.

=head2 The Three Phases

A parser needs to:

=over

=item * Accept a grammar.

=item * Read input.

=item * Return values from the parses,
according to a semantics.

=back

In Marpa these three tasks
are, for the most part, distinct phases.
Grammars are L<Marpa::Grammar> objects.
The reading of input and the evaluation of the parse
according to the semantics is performed by
L<Marpa::Recognizer> objects.

=head1 EXAMPLE 1: A SIMPLE CALCULATOR

The synopsis shows the code for a very simple calculator.
It handles only
addition and multiplication of integers.
This section explains, line by line, how it works.

=head2 Marpa::Grammar::new

=for Marpa::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    my $grammar = Marpa::Grammar->new(
        {   start   => 'Expression',
            actions => 'My_Actions',
            default_action => 'first_arg',
            rules   => [
                { lhs => 'Expression', rhs => [qw/Term/] },
                { lhs => 'Term', rhs => [qw/Factor/] },
                { lhs => 'Factor', rhs => [qw/Number/] },
                { lhs => 'Term', rhs => [qw/Term Add Term/], action => 'do_add' },
                {   lhs    => 'Factor',
                    rhs    => [qw/Factor Multiply Factor/],
                    action => 'do_multiply'
                },
            ],
        }
    );

=for Marpa::Display::End

Marpa grammars are L<Marpa::Grammar> objects.
They are created
with the
L<Marpa::Grammar::new|Marpa::Grammar/"new">
constructor.
The arguments to 
L<Marpa::Grammar::new|Marpa::Grammar/"new">
are references to
hashes of named arguments.
In the key/value pairs of these hashes,
the
hash key
is the
name of the argument,
and the
hash value
is the
value of the named argument.

=head3 The start Named Argument

=for Marpa::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    start => 'Expression',

=for Marpa::Display::End

The C<start> named argument is required.
Its value is
a string containing the name of the grammar's start symbol.

=head3 Named Arguments for the Semantics

=for Marpa::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

            actions => 'My_Actions',
            default_action => 'first_arg',

=for Marpa::Display::End

The C<actions> and C<default_action> named arguments specify
semantics.
Their argument values are strings,
which acquire their semantics during evaluation.

Evaluation will be described later.
Peeking ahead,
the C<default_action> named argument
will be interpreted
as an action name.
This action name will resolve to a Perl closure
that implements the semantics for rules
without a per-rule semantics.
C<actions> will be the name
of a Perl package where Marpa looks for
the semantic Perl closures.

=head3 The rules Named Argument

=for Marpa::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    rules => [
        { lhs => 'Expression', rhs => [qw/Term/] },
        { lhs => 'Term',       rhs => [qw/Factor/] },
        { lhs => 'Factor',     rhs => [qw/Number/] },
        { lhs => 'Term', rhs => [qw/Term Add Term/], action => 'do_add' },
        {   lhs    => 'Factor',
            rhs    => [qw/Factor Multiply Factor/],
            action => 'do_multiply'
        },
    ],

=for Marpa::Display::End

The value of the
C<rules> named argument is a reference to an array of
B<rule descriptors>.
In this example, all the rule descriptors are in the "long" form --
they are references to hashes of B<rule properties>.
In each key/value pair of a rule descriptor hash, the key is
the name of a rule property, and the hash value is the value of
that rule property.

=head4 The lhs Property

The value of the C<lhs> rule property must be a string containing
the name of the rule's left hand side symbol.
Every Marpa rule must have a left hand side symbol.

=head4 The rhs Property

The value of the C<rhs> property is a reference to
an array of strings containing
names of the rule's right hand symbols,
in order.
This array may be zero length, in which case
this is an B<empty rule> --
a rule with no symbols on the right hand side.
A rule is also empty if
there is no C<rhs> specifier in its descriptor.
There are no empty rules in this example.

=head4 The action Property

The value of the C<action> rule property is a string.
What the string means is up to the evaluator.
Peeking ahead, each C<action> property string
will be interpreted
as an action name.
This action name will be resolved
to a Perl closure that
implements 
the rule's semantics.

=head2 Marpa::Grammar::precompute

=for Marpa::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    $grammar->precompute();

=for Marpa::Display::End

Before a Marpa grammar object can be used by a Marpa recognizer,
it must be B<precomputed>.
Precomputation compiles data structures that the recognizer will need.

=head2 Marpa::Recognizer::new

=for Marpa::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    my $recce = Marpa::Recognizer->new( { grammar => $grammar } );

=for Marpa::Display::End

C<Marpa::Recognizer::new> creates a new recognizer.
Its arguments are references to hashes of named arguments.
In this example the only named argument is
"C<grammar>", which is required.
The value of the 
C<grammar> 
named argument must be a precomputed Marpa
grammar for the
recognizer to use in building its tables.

=head2 Marpa::Recognizer::tokens

=for Marpa::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    my @tokens = (
        [ 'Number', 42 ],
        [ 'Multiply', ],
        [ 'Number', 1 ],
        [ 'Add', ],
        [ 'Number', 7 ],
    );

    $recce->tokens( \@tokens );

=for Marpa::Display::End

C<Marpa::Recognizer::tokens> reads the input to be recognized.
Its first (and in our example, only)
argument is a reference to an array of B<token descriptors>.
Each token descriptor is an array reference.

The first element of a token descriptor is a string containing the
B<token name>.
The token name must be the name
of a valid terminal symbol in the grammar.
By default all symbols are valid as terminal symbols,
unless a grammar contains empty rules.

The grammars in our examples do not contain empty
rules,
and therefore we are free to use any symbol in the
grammar as a token name.
For more on terminals,
including how to explicitly mark terminal symbols
when the grammar contains empty rules,
see L<Marpa::Grammar/"Terminals">.

The second element of a token descriptor is the B<token value>.
A token value must be a Perl scalar, but otherwise its form
and semantics
are entirely up to the application.
If the token value is omitted,
it is a Perl C<undef>.
In the calculator example, the values of the
"C<Add>" 
and "C<Multiply>" tokens are never used,
so they are allowed to default to C<undef>.

=head2 Marpa::Recognizer::value

=for Marpa::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    my $value_ref = $recce->value;
    my $value = $value_ref ? ${$value_ref} : 'No Parse';

=for Marpa::Display::End

The C<Marpa::Recognizer::value> method returns
a reference to the parse result's value,
if there was a parse result.
If there was no parse result,
C<Marpa::Recognizer::value>
returns
C<undef>.

=head2 Resolving the Semantics

The first thing Marpa::Recognizer::value needs to do is
resolve the semantics.
B<Resolving the semantics> means
mapping the action names into
semantic Perl closures.
B<Semantic Perl closures> are Perl
closures which directly implement semantics.
In this example,
the C<actions> named argument is interpreted as
a Perl package name.
Marpa will look for its semantic Perl closures
in that package.

=for Marpa::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    actions => 'My_Actions',

=for Marpa::Display::End

=for Marpa::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1
flatten: 1

    { lhs => 'Factor', rhs => [qw/Factor Multiply Factor/], action => 'do_multiply' },

=for Marpa::Display::End

For example, the C<action> property for the above rule
is "C<do_multiply>" and the C<actions> named argument to the grammar
was "C<My_Actions>".
So Marpa looks for a closure whose fully qualified name is C<My_Actions::do_multiply>,
which it finds.

=for Marpa::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    sub My_Actions::do_multiply {
        my ( undef, $t1, undef, $t2 ) = @_;
        return $t1 * $t2;
    }

=for Marpa::Display::End

Rules do not always have C<action> properties.
That is the case with these rules in this example:

=for Marpa::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    { lhs => 'Expression', rhs => [qw/Term/] },
    { lhs => 'Term', rhs => [qw/Factor/] },
    { lhs => 'Factor', rhs => [qw/Number/] },

=for Marpa::Display::End

Where there is no C<action> rule property,
Marpa tries to use the
C<lhs> property
as an action name.
When Marpa cannot resolve the C<lhs> property
as an action name, it will fall back to
using the 
default action for the grammar.

For example, for the first rule in the above display,
Marpa will look for a Perl closure with the fully qualified
name "C<My_Actions::Expression>".
When Marpa does not find a closure by that name,
Marpa will fall back to trying to find a semantic Perl closure
using the default action.

The other two rules in the above display work similarly.
Marpa will look for Perl closures
named "C<My_Actions::Term>"
and "C<My_Actions::Factor>".
It will not find them and will fall back to trying to use
the default action,
as described next.

=for Marpa::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    default_action => 'first_arg',

=for Marpa::Display::End

The C<default_action> named argument is resolved in the same way
as are the C<action> properties of the
rules.
In this example,
default_action is specified as "C<first_arg>"
and resolves to
C<My_Actions::first_arg>.

=head2 Semantic Perl Closures

=for Marpa::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    sub My_Actions::first_arg { shift; return shift; }

=for Marpa::Display::End

=for Marpa::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Unambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    sub My_Actions::do_add {
        my ( undef, $t1, undef, $t2 ) = @_;
        return $t1 + $t2;
    }

=for Marpa::Display::End

The semantic Perl closures are callbacks,
called when each node in a parse tree is evaluated.
The callbacks receive one or more arguments.
The first argument to a semantic Perl closure is always a per-parse-result
object, which the callbacks can use as a scratchpad.
In these examples, the per-parse-result object is not used.

For a non-empty rule,
the second and any subsequent arguments to the callback are
the values,
in lexical order,
of the symbols on the right hand side of
the rule.
If the semantic Perl closure is for an empty rule,
the per-parse-result object will be its only argument.

Every semantic Perl closure is expected to return a value.
With one exception,
this value is passed up to a parent node
as an argument.
The exception is the value for the start rule.
The return value for the start rule
becomes the value of the parse result.

Rules with no action specified for them take their
semantics from The C<default_action> named argument.
If there is no default action for a grammar,
rules without no action specified for them
return a Perl C<undef>.

=head1 EXAMPLE 2: AN AMBIGUOUS PARSE

This is the same calculator as before,
rewritten to be ambiguous.
Rather than give multiplication precedence over
addition,
the rewritten calculator allows any order of operations.
In this example,
the semantic Perl closures (C<My_Actions::do_add>, etc.)
and the C<@tokens> array remain
the same as before.

Eliminating precedence makes the grammar shorter,
but it also means there can be multiple parse results,
and the different parse results can have different values.
In this application we decide, for each input,
to return the value for every one of the parse results.

=for Marpa::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Ambiguous Parse
perltidy: '-dcsc -sil=0'

    my $ambiguous_grammar = Marpa::Grammar->new(
        {   start   => 'E',
            actions => 'My_Actions',
            rules   => [
                [ 'E', [qw/E Add E/],      'do_add' ],
                [ 'E', [qw/E Multiply E/], 'do_multiply' ],
                [ 'E', [qw/Number/],       ],
            ],
            default_action => 'first_arg',
        }
    );

    $ambiguous_grammar->precompute();

    my $ambiguous_recce =
        Marpa::Recognizer->new( { grammar => $ambiguous_grammar } );

    $ambiguous_recce->tokens( \@tokens );

    my @values = ();
    while ( defined( my $ambiguous_value_ref = $ambiguous_recce->value() ) ) {
        push @values, ${$ambiguous_value_ref};
    }

=for Marpa::Display::End

=head2 Short Form Rule Descriptors

=for Marpa::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Ambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    rules => [
        [ 'E', [qw/E Add E/],      'do_add' ],
        [ 'E', [qw/E Multiply E/], 'do_multiply' ],
        [ 'E', [qw/Number/], ],
    ],

=for Marpa::Display::End

The rule descriptors in the
ambiguous example demonstrate the "short" or array form of rule
descriptors.
Array form rule descriptors are references to arrays.
Here the elements are, in order,
the C<lhs> property,
the C<rhs> property,
and the C<action> property.

=head2 Marpa::Recognizer::value

=for Marpa::Display
name: Engine Synopsis Ambiguous Parse
partial: 1
normalize-whitespace: 1

    my @values = ();
    while ( defined( my $ambiguous_value_ref = $ambiguous_recce->value() ) ) {
        push @values, ${$ambiguous_value_ref};
    }

=for Marpa::Display::End

When called more than once,
the C<Marpa::Recognizer::value> method iterates through the parse results.
For each cvall,
it returns a reference to the value of a parse result.
At the end of the iteration, after
all parse results have been returned,
C<Marpa::Recognizer::value> returns C<undef>.
If there were no parse results,
C<Marpa::Recognizer::value> returns C<undef> the first
time that it is called.

=head1 ERRORS AND EXCEPTIONS

Methods in the Marpa API do not return errors.
When there are errors,
Marpa API methods throw an exception.

=head2 Why is it Called "Marpa"?

Marpa is the name of the greatest of the Tibetan "translators".
In his time (the 11th century AD) Indian Buddhism was
at its height.  A generation of scholars was devoting
itself to producing Tibetan versions of Buddhism's Sanskrit scriptures.
Marpa became the greatest of them,
and today is known as Marpa Lotsawa: "Marpa the Translator".

=head2 Blatant Plug

Marpa is a character in my novel, B<The God Proof>.
B<The God
Proof> centers around Kurt GE<ouml>del's proof of God's existence.
Yes, I<that> Kurt GE<ouml>del, and yes, he really did work out a
God Proof (it's in his I<Collected Works>, Vol. 3, pp. 403-404).
B<The God Proof> is available
as a free download (L<http://www.lulu.com/content/933192>).
It can be purchased in print form at Amazon.com:
L<http://www.amazon.com/God-Proof-Jeffrey-Kegler/dp/1434807355>.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Marpa is
directly derived from two other parsers.
The first was discovered by
John Aycock and
R.  Nigel Horspool
and is described in their
L<Aycock and Horspool 2002|Marpa::Bibliography/"Aycock and Horspool 2002">.
The second was described by Joop Leo and is described in
L<Leo 1991|Marpa::Bibliography/"Leo 1991">.
Aycock, Horspool, and Leo, in turn, based their
algorithms on the
L<algorithm discovered by Jay Earley|Marpa::Bibliography/"Earley 1970">.
I combined the Aycock-Horspool algorithm with the Leo algorithm,
and added significant changes of my own.
More details on the algorithm itself are in
L<another document|Marpa::Algorithm>.

I'm grateful to Randal Schwartz for his support over the years that
I've been working on Marpa.
My chats with
Larry Wall have been few and brief,
but his openness to new ideas has been
a major encouragement
and his insight into the relationship between
"natural language" and computer language
has been a major influence.
More recently,
Allison Randal and Patrick Michaud have been generous with their
very valuable time.
They might have preferred that I volunteered as a Parrot cage-cleaner,
but if so, they were too polite to say.

Many at perlmonks.org answered questions for me.
I used answers from
chromatic, Corion, dragonchild,
jdporter, samtregar and Juerd,
among others,
in writing this module.
I'm just as grateful to those whose answers I didn't use.
My inquiries were made while I was thinking out the code and
it wasn't always 100% clear what I was after.
If the butt is moved after the round,
it shouldn't count against the archer.

In writing the Pure Perl version of Marpa, I benefited from studying
the work of Francois Desarmenien (C<Parse::Yapp>), 
Damian Conway (C<Parse::RecDescent>) and
Graham Barr (C<Scalar::Util>).
Adam Kennedy patiently instructed me
in module writing,
both on the finer points and
on issues about which I really should have know better.
