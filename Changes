Revision history for Marpa

0.208000 Wed Nov 30 20:29:11 PST 2011

    * Add language deprecating this distribution
      in favor of Marpa::XS

0.206000 Sat Oct 29 18:05:40 PDT 2011

    * Ensure that the Marpa module is never
      loaded together with Marpa::PP or Marpa::XS.

0.204000 Mon May  2 16:20:27 2011

    * Fixed documentation error:
      Added "use Marpa;"

0.202000 Sun Jan  9 20:46:35 2011

    * Retro-port minor CHAF bug fix from Marpa::XS --
      In certain unusual circumstances,
      Nulling symbols following proper nullables might be
      omitted.  The case is obscure enough that I only discovered
      it by reading the code -- it never emerged in testing.
      But now it is fixed.

    * Generation 2 evaluator now is
      deprecated and will be removed
      in the future.

    * Fixed failure to install on systems without PPI.
